# YELP LITE

This project takes in a publicly downloaded Yelp dataset and returns a list of restaurant recommendations based on a user's reviewing habit. 

Given a particular userID, it is able to run two queries: 
1. List of restaurant recommendations above a certain rating.
2. List of restaurant recommendations with at least a certain number of co-reviewers.

A co-reviewer here is defined as a user that has reviewed a restaurant that you have also reviewed.
